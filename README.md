## Procject recomendation
Create a simple todo app in either TypeScript or JavaScript and a Framework of your choice.

The appliction:

  A multi-line input
  A add task buttton
  A list of previously added tasks
Each task should:

  Show there text
  A delete button
  Be be easy to tell appart from the next


#This project was bootstrapped with react js and bootstrap 5.3.1 .
# How to run Todo App

## To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:
##  npm install  to install dependancies
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Test in the future
### `npm test`

##Once done the finished result should be uploaded to GitHub with a short description of:

 ## Why you shose to implement the list in the way you did
  # Fist of all the choice of the framework is based on the performance , code reuse and maintainability(scalable)
  
  With react I created less code than if i could use vanila javascript because in plain javascript one needs to go trough steps in order to manupulate just one element in the DOM.
  -As you can see i created all my elements as component that can be usefull for  maintainability and code reuse.
  
  -In real world application these components can be used in different part of the application by passing the desire props and render the desire output.
  
  -React requires you to break your UI into components and  be reusable.
  
  
  ##How to run it

  # Not done
  ## What you would improve on it if you where to work on it again
  I could  improve the design by adding more feature to make the app user friendly such as  check box to  track the status of the  task ( complete, in progress, and not completed).
